This is an attempt at doing the euler project in perhaps various languages. The idea is to keep my skills in shape for the languages I find most interesting/valuable. I'm most likely to use one or more of the following languages:
- Java
- Python
- Lua

Languages I'll absolutely never used unless forced at gunpoint:
- Perl
